## Intuition
Briefly describe the thinking process before coding.
Why does this approach make sense?
---
## Approach
- Explain the main steps of the algorithm
- Mention any data structures used
- Point out possible edge cases
---
## Proof of Correctness
Why does this algorithm always work?
Any mathematical reasoning or invariants here.
---
## Complexity
- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(n)
(These are also stored in the `Time` and `Space` properties for metadata,
but include them here for human readers.)
